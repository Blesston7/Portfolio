      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! I’m a curious and driven developer with a love for clean code, clever problem-solving, and continuous learning. I’m currently exploring the world of Python and object-oriented programming, and I enjoy turning concepts into real, working solutions.
        With a strong foundation in logic and a growing toolkit of development skills, I’m on a mission to build meaningful, user-friendly applications. I believe in learning by doing, growing through challenges, and always staying curious. 
        Let’s connect and create something amazing!
